 dbo_advanced_devshirme_system_policy_desc: "It is the cornerstone of the Ottoman Empire’s manpower and bureaucratic administration. It is based on selecting talented children from the nonMuslim population of the Balkans and Anatolia and bringing them into state service. These youths, after undergoing strict training, are sent either to the Janissary Corps according to their military aptitude or to the Enderun School according to their administrative intelligence, forming the highest-ranking administrative cadres of the empire. This system strengthens central authority by creating a class of administrators loyal to the dynasty and independent of land‑owning nobles."
