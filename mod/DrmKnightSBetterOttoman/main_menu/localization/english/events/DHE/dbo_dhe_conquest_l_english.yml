 dbo_dhe_conquest.1001.historical_info: "The Battle of Manzikert (1071) became one of the turning points that determined the fate of Anatolia, and after this victory the region was fully opened to Turkish incursions and settlement. With Byzantine authority severely weakened, no central power emerged in Anatolia; instead, a fragmented political landscape known as the First Beyliks Period took shape.\nDuring this era, various Turkmen principalities such as the Danishmends, Saltukids, Mengujekids, Artukids, and the Beylik of Çaka ruled across Anatolia, each seeking military, political, and cultural dominance in their respective regions. At the same time, the Anatolian Seljuk State emerged with the goal of establishing a permanent and centralized Turkish state in the region. However, Anatolia was far from unified under a single authority; Turkish political unity was effectively fragmented.\nThe Anatolian Seljuk State undertook long and difficult campaigns to establish lasting control and unify Turkish political authority. These efforts were not limited to military conquest; diplomacy, marriage alliances, and influence strategies also played key roles. Over time, the Seljuks succeeded in asserting dominance over much of Anatolia, largely achieving Turkish political unity. This period marked an age of rising prosperity, accelerated Turkification and Islamization, urban development, and revitalized trade routes.\nHowever, this unity did not last. The Seljuks’ defeat by the Mongols at the Battle of Köse Dağ in 1243 deeply shook their authority, and central governance effectively collapsed. While Seljuk sultans fell under Mongol influence, Turkmen beys in frontier regions began acting independently once more.\nAs a result, the Second Beyliks Period began, with new principalities such as the Karamanids, Germiyanids, Aydınids, Menteşe, Candarids, and the Ottomans emerging. Anatolia again became politically fragmented, yet this fragmentation laid the groundwork for a new rise and the eventual birth of the Ottoman Empire."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1002.historical_info: "After largely securing political unity in Anatolia, [GetCountry('TUR').GetName] directed its policy of conquest and expansion toward Rumelia. The military and economic weakening of the Byzantine Empire, internal conflicts among Balkan states, and the fragmented feudal structure created a favorable environment for Ottoman expansion. The capture of Çimpe Castle became the first permanent Ottoman foothold in Rumelia and opened the way for conquests across Thrace.\nRumelia’s conquest was not sustained solely through rapid military campaigns; it was solidified through settlement policies, the timar system, and balanced relations with local populations. Turkish settlers brought from Anatolia were placed in newly conquered regions, ensuring security and strengthening Ottoman administrative structures. Major battles such as Sırpsındığı and the First Battle of Kosovo became turning points that cemented Ottoman dominance in the Balkans.\nThe Ottomans not only gained territory in Rumelia but also extended their tax system, judicial order, and military organization across the region, establishing lasting central authority. Over time, Rumelia became one of the main pillars of the Ottoman army and bureaucracy through the devshirme system and its strong economic resources. Strategically, it served as the empire’s gateway into Europe. In this sense, the conquest of Rumelia is regarded as one of the fundamental stages that transformed the Ottoman state from a beylik into a multi‑continental empire."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1003.historical_info: "Ottoman control over the Fertile Crescent was one of the most significant gains that deepened the empire’s military, economic, and strategic power. This ancient region, encompassing Mesopotamia and Syria, held immense value due to its agricultural productivity, dense population, and long‑established trade routes. In the early 16th century, the defeat of the Mamluk Sultanate brought Syria and Palestine under Ottoman rule, creating a continuous zone of control between Anatolia and Egypt and integrating the Fertile Crescent into the Ottoman administrative and military system. Subsequent consolidation in Mesopotamia secured east–west trade routes and the safety of the Euphrates–Tigris basin.\nOttoman administration in the Fertile Crescent prioritized agricultural productivity and urban stability. The region played a vital role in the empire’s provisioning system, supplying major cities and armies. Additionally, the Syria–Iraq corridor served as a logistical base for eastern campaigns. The incorporation of the Fertile Crescent not only brought economic benefits but also created strategic stability along the empire’s eastern frontier. It strengthened Ottoman influence in its rivalry with Iran and made the empire a decisive actor in the political order of the Middle East."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1004.desc: "$dbo_conquest_arabian_peninsula_stamp_desc$"
 dbo_dhe_conquest.1004.historical_info: "Ottoman control over the Arabian Peninsula was not the result of a single sudden conquest but a long process shaped by military victories, political maneuvering, and religious legitimacy. This transformation elevated the Ottomans from a regional power to the central authority of the Islamic world. The struggle with the Mamluk Sultanate in the early 16th century laid the foundation for Ottoman expansion into Arab lands. With the victories at Marj Dabiq and Ridaniye, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt came under Ottoman rule, opening the way toward the Arabian Peninsula.\nFollowing the conquest of Egypt, Mecca and Medina recognized Ottoman authority without conflict. This elevated the Ottoman sultans to the custodians of the holy cities and bearers of the caliphate. In the Hijaz, the Ottomans adopted a protective approach rather than imposing direct, harsh rule—ensuring the security of pilgrimage routes and meeting the needs of the holy cities. This policy allowed the Ottomans to be seen not as foreign conquerors but as guardians of order and stability.\nIn Yemen, Basra, and the Persian Gulf, Ottoman authority was shaped by the need to protect trade routes in the Indian Ocean and defend against external threats. Although the region occasionally saw uprisings, Ottoman influence remained enduring. The significance of Ottoman rule over the Arabian Peninsula lay more in its religious and political implications than in economic gain. The protection of Mecca and Medina granted the sultans unparalleled prestige and legitimacy in the Islamic world, strengthening diplomacy, internal stability, and authority across the broader Muslim realm."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1005.historical_info: "The conquest of Egypt was not merely the acquisition of new territory but a turning point that fundamentally reshaped the identity and role of the Ottoman Empire. With this conquest, the Ottomans transformed from a regional superpower centered on Anatolia and Rumelia into a vast empire spanning three continents with political, military, and religious influence far beyond its borders.\nThe transfer of the caliphate to the Ottoman dynasty elevated the sultan to the legitimate leader of the Islamic world, while the guardianship of Mecca and Medina made the empire a direct representative of religious authority. This strengthened internal stability and granted the Ottomans unmatched legitimacy and influence in foreign affairs.\nEgypt’s wealth—its agricultural output from the Nile Valley and Cairo’s commercial networks—provided the empire with a steady and reliable source of revenue. Control over trade routes extending into the Eastern Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Indian Ocean positioned the Ottomans as a key actor in global commerce, counterbalancing European expansion toward the East.\nPolitically, the conquest of Egypt placed the Ottomans at the center of the Islamic world. The empire now competed simultaneously with the Safavids in the east, European kingdoms in the west, and maritime powers in the Indian Ocean. This moment represents the pinnacle of the Ottoman rise, marking the transition from a conquering state to one that established order, directed trade, and led the spiritual world of Islam."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1006.historical_info: "Ottoman dominance over the Black Sea and Crimea represents a strategic transformation that unified naval power, trade control, and northern security. This process turned the Black Sea from an open arena of competition into a de facto Ottoman inland sea. The conquest of Constantinople placed the Bosporus under Ottoman control, determining the fate of the Black Sea. By regulating passage through the straits, the Ottomans weakened the influence of Genoese colonies and foreign maritime powers.\nAs ports along the southern and eastern coasts came under Ottoman rule, regional trade became centered on Istanbul. The incorporation of Crimea completed this transformation. With the Crimean Khanate accepting Ottoman suzerainty, the northern steppes were secured. Rather than direct annexation, the Ottomans maintained local governance, ensuring regional stability. This relationship provided military support and created a buffer zone against northern threats.\nEconomically, Black Sea and Crimean control was vital. Grain trade, port revenues, and regional trade routes came under Ottoman authority, ensuring the provisioning of Istanbul. The Ottoman navy became unrivaled in the Black Sea, reinforcing maritime supremacy. Ultimately, control over the Black Sea and Crimea granted the empire military security, economic strength, and strategic depth—demonstrating that the Ottomans were not only a land empire but also a formidable naval power."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1010.historical_info: "Ottoman rule in Tripolitania and the Maghreb was shaped in the 16th century through the support of local Muslim populations and the strategic actions of legendary corsairs such as Hayreddin Barbarossa, Oruç Reis, and Turgut Reis against the rising Spanish‑Habsburg threat in the Mediterranean. With the annexation of Algiers in 1533, the conquest of Tripoli from the Knights of St. John in 1551, and the complete liberation of Tunis from Spanish occupation in 1574, the region was incorporated into the empire as the 'Western Eyalets.' Except for Morocco, the entire North African coast came under Ottoman political and military influence for centuries."

 dbo_dhe_conquest.1011.historical_info: "Ottoman rule in the Caucasus can be summarized in four main phases:\n1. Entry (1461–1514): The conquest of Trabzon by Mehmed II marked the first step into the region. Selim I’s victory at Chaldiran weakened Safavid influence and initiated Ottoman dominance.\n2. Zenith (1578–1590): During the reign of Murad III, campaigns brought Georgia, Dagestan, and Shirvan (Azerbaijan) under Ottoman control. The Treaty of Ferhat Pasha in 1590 marked the empire’s easternmost territorial expansion.\n3. Balance and Division (1639): The Treaty of Zuhab (Kasr‑ı Şirin) divided the Caucasus between the Ottomans and Safavids, establishing a long‑lasting border with western Georgia under Ottoman rule and eastern regions under Iranian control.\n4. Struggle with Russia and Loss (1829–1878): From the 18th century onward, Russia’s southward expansion led to major conflicts. With the Treaties of Edirne (1829) and Berlin (1878), the region gradually came under full Russian control."
