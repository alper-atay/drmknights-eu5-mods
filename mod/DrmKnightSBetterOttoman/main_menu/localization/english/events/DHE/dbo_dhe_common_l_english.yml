 dbo_dhe_common.1001.desc: "With the conquest of Constantinople opening a new era, our state now proclaims absolute and eternal dominion over the rest of Anatolia following Rumelia.\nThe age of rivalry among the beyliks has been consigned to the dusty pages of history, and all remaining banners have joined our ranks as unshakable parts of our central authority.\nThe once‑independent beyliks now strengthen our power as provinces of the capital, and this process of complete unification—where not a single dissenting voice remains in Anatolia—reaches its conclusion.\nAs this vast land stretching from east to west is sealed with a single imperial seal, the shadow of our banner proclaims to the entire world the birth of a global empire spanning continents.\nOur strength has united, our will has gathered in a single center; no force shall stand in the way of this magnificent rise."
 dbo_dhe_common.1001.a: "Unite all Anatolian Beyliks under our banner!"
 dbo_dhe_common.1001.b: "No, we shall claim their lands on the battlefield!"
